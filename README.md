## Overview

Talent Protocol leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized talent marketplace where builders (developers, creators, etc.) can showcase their skills, connect with opportunities, and monetize their expertise. This repository focuses on the subscription model for builders, potentially allowing:
- Subscription-based access to premium features or services.
- Recurring revenue models for builders within the Talent Protocol ecosystem.
- Integration with smart contracts for secure, transparent subscription management.

This project is in its early stages and welcomes contributions from the community to expand its capabilities.
